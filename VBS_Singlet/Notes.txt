Here are notes for running on lighthouse/physdoe:

Have VBSjobarray.sh set up to submit a job array of MG5 simulations. Currently need to run 40 sims with 2500 events each, note these are hard coded elsewhere

TODO: find way to not hard code simulation parameters (number of jobs in array, MH, sin alpha etc..)

Process jobs runs over all the outputs of a simulation and looks for bad files, computes cross section etc.
